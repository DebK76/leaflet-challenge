# leaflet-challenge
Using HTML and JavaScript to visualize earthquake data across the United States amongst other things.

Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. So, In this challenge, I am tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Before I Begin
I started by creating a new repository for this project called leaflet-challenge. Cloned the new repository to my computer.

Inside the local git repository, I created a directory for the Leaflet challenge with the appropriate folder names to correspond to the challenges: Leaflet-Part-1 and Leaflet-Part-2 (optional). I focused on primarily on part 1.

This Challenge uses both HTML and JavaScript. Pushing the above changes to GitHub once completed.

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
First task is to visualize an earthquake dataset from the USGS website that provides earthquake data in a number of different formats.
I chose to analyse the dataset for ("All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days") using the URL to pull in the JSOn represented data for the visualization.

Please see final output...
